== "code point" vs. "codepoint"

The Unicode standard consistently uses "code point". On the other
hand, Ruby's String class has an "each_codepoint" method.

Beginning with version 1.3.0, UnicodeUtils will use "code point"
and the related Ruby symbol names "code_point", "CODE_POINT" and
"CodePoint" throughout.

The only exception is the "UnicodeUtils::Codepoint" class, which
predates UnicodeUtils 1.3.0.

== char_name

Unfortunately deviates from the Unicode Name property.

Possible course of action:
* Add consistent way to access all Unicode properties
  E.g. UnicodeUtils::General_Category[code_point],
  UnicodeUtils::Name[code_point], ...
* Deprecate char_name

== Encoding of string property values

The encoding of spring property values is currently undocumented.

Possible course of action:
* Use the same encoding for all string property values, preferably UTF-8
* Document it
